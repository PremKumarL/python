    "__Q. Where should you use a for loop instead of a while loop?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everywhere. The while loop has its uses, but it is also prone to throw off errors. As a beginner, try to minimize the number of while loops in your programs and stick to for loops instead. Sure, there are problems where you can’t help but use a while loop, but if possible, stick to for loops – whether you’re printing a list of numbers, working with lists, or making decisions with if-else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Q. How many for loops can I nest inside existing loops?__\n",
    "\n",
    "As many as you want (or as many as the program requires). But like if-else statements, it’s best to limit for loops to two levels deep. Deeper than that and you’ll start walking towards ‘bad practice’ territory (and other programmers won’t like you anymore).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Q. I saw a ‘pass’ command in some code online. What is that?__\n",
    "\n",
    "A ‘pass’ command is basically an empty placeholder. It doesn’t do anything, but is used in a place where some code is required syntactically. For an example, look at the question below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Q. What is the difference between range and xrange?__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you looked up range online, you may have encountered xrange as well. xrange is another way to specify range when using a for loop. It works exactly like range, except that it is faster and more memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use range, you essentially create a list which Python reiterates through. Thus, `for x in range(0, 100)` basically creates a temporary list with numbers from 0 to 100. As the for loop is executed, Python goes through each element in this list. This can be slow, especially when dealing with very large range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "xrange on the other hand, generates an object that creates the number(s) required in the range. Understanding how this works requires going into object-oriented programming, which is an entirely new ball game altogether."

    "The **flyweight pattern** is used for memory optimization. For programmers new to python programming language, the tendency is to ignore the memory optimization assuming the garbage collector will take care of that. However, when developing large applications with many related objjects, paying a close attention to memory concerns can have a huge payoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the flyweight pattern is to ensure that the objects that share a state can use the same memory for that shared state. Using the flyweight pattern, we have the shared objects for the list of features associated with a model and then simply reference that model, along with additional features for individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our design example we will define the problem as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider a computer manufacturing giant has given us the task to create an efficient memory based model to enter and access features of their product line. In our case, let us consider that the computer gaint sells laptops only. Their laptops are in the high price range and serves a niche market. Let us list down the common featres for their laptops\n",

    "* HD Display\n",
    "* HDD Solid State\n",
    "* HDMI Port\n",
    "* High Durable Battery\n",
    "* Anti Glare Protection\n",
    "* Fast OS\n",
    "\n",
    "Having considered the obvious common attributes of their laptop line, let us list down the specifications that uniquely define the laptops\n",
    "\n",
    "* Screen Size              (14/15 inch)\n",
    "* RAM Size                 (4/8/16GB)\n",
    "* HDD Size(solid state)    1/2/4/8 TB\n",
    "* Color                    R/G/B   \n",
    "\n",
    "For our simplicity, let us consider the companay generates a Model number based on Screen Size, Ram Size and HDD Size:\n",
    "For example Deluxe Range model, 15inch, 4GB, 8TB system the Serial Number:  DR-15-4-8-R< batchnumber> \n",
    "\n",
    "As per our design approach, we may see here that there are common attributes for all the laptops and also individual attributes to distinguish the product. Can we define an efficent data structure model so that there is minimum wastage of memory? Hint:  Instantiate the common set once and instantiate repeately the unique set every time a new product in catalogue is entered.\n",
